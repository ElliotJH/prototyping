<p>This tool will guide you through the process of creating a lasting power of attorney (LPA). When you've finished you'll be able to print out the completed LPA and get it signed and registered.</p>

<p>An LPA is a powerful legal document that allows someone (the 'donor') to choose other people (the 'attorneys') to make decisions on their behalf if they lose the mental capacity to make those decisions themselves. If you're not yet familiar with the process we suggest that you find out more before continuing.</p>
