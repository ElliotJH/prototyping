          <summary>What is an attorney?</summary>
          <p>An attorney is a person appointed by <a href="">the donor</a> to make decisions on the donor's behalf when they are unable to make decisions for themselves.</p>
        </details>
        <details>
          <summary>What is a replacement attorney?</summary>
          <p>The donor can appoint one or more replacement attorneys to take over if one of the original attorneys can no longer act for them (if an attorney dies, loses capacity or decides they do not want to act as an attorney). It's a good idea to include at least one replacement attorney.</p>
        </details>
        <details>
          <summary>Who can be an attorney?</summary>
          <p>Anyone aged 18 or over can be an attorney, including a family member, friend, professional (eg a solicitor) or spouse, partner or civil partner. An attorney for a property and financial affairs LPA cannot be bankrupt. An attorney for a health and welfare LPA must be an individual. The donor can appoint one or more attorneys.</p>

          <p>It is very important that the donor completely trusts the people they appoint as attorneys, because the LPA will allow attorneys to make all the decisions that the donor would otherwise make.</p>
        </details>
        <details>
          <summary>What makes a good attorney?</summary>
          <p>A good attorney should:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>know the donor well enough to make decisions on their behalf</li>
            <li>be trusted to make decisions in the donor's best interests</li>
            <li>be willing to act on behalf of the donor</li>
          </ul>
        </details>
        <details>
          <summary>What information will I need to provide for each attorney?</summary>
          <p>You'll need to tell us:</p>
          <ul>
          <li>their name, age and address</li>
          <li>how they should <a href="">make decisions</a></li>
          <li>about any <a href="">conditions or guidance</a> they should follow</li>
        </ul>
