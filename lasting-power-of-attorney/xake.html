<h2>How do I make a lasting power of attorney (LPA)?</h2>

<p>It's a three-step process.</p>

<ol class="process overview">
  <li>
    <h3>1. Create an <abbr>LPA</abbr></h3>

<h2>How much does it cost to register an LPA?</h2>
<p>The fee to process and register an LPA is &pound;130 for each LPA. People on very low incomes and people who receive certain benefits may be able to pay a lower fee.</p>

<h2>What happens after I submit my registration documents?</h2>
<p>There is a minimum six week waiting period before your LPA can be registered and returned to you. It will then be ready for use.</p>

<p>This is to give people an opportunity to raise any
concerns about the LPA (for example, if they think you're being forced into making
it, or that a fraud has been committed). You will be asked when you create your LPA
who you would like to tell about it.
</p>
<p>It also gives the Office of the Public Guardian time to check that the LPA has been made correctly and that there is nothing that would make it invalid, or that should be corrected before it can be registered.</p>
