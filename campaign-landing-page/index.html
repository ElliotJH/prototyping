	<h2>Workplace pensions &mdash; what it means for you</h2>
	<p>Starting from October 2012, millions of workers will be enrolled into a workplace pension. Your employer and the government will also pay into it - making it a hassle-free way of saving while you earn - and, when you retire, it will give you more to live on than just your State Pension.</p>
	<p>Your employer will enrol you automatically, with people from larger employers being enrolled first, but you're totally free to opt out if you want to.</p>
