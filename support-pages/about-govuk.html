<h2 id="question1">What is GOV.UK?</h2>

<p>GOV.UK is the best place to find government services and information. This website replaces Business Link and Directgov, and is the first step towards a single domain for most of government.</p>

<p>It is simpler, clearer and faster for users and will, over time, become more comprehensive, as more government websites move into GOV.UK.</p>

<h2 id="question2">Where can I find GOV.UK?</h2>

<p>GOV.UK can be found by typing <a href="www.gov.uk">www.gov.uk</a> into your browser or search engine of choice.</p>

<h2 id="question3">Who built GOV.UK?</h2>

<p>GOV.UK has been built by the Government Digital Service, or ‘GDS’, who are part of the Cabinet Office. You can find out more about the team at <a href="http://digital.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/">http://digital.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/</a></p>

<h2 id="question4">What information can I find on GOV.UK?</h2>

<p>From 17 October you’ll be able to find information for the majority of UK citizens and businesses on GOV.UK. Over time, more information will be added to to the website, including specialist information for professionals and detailed information on government policy. You can find out more about what is being added to GOV.UK at <a href="http://digital.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/">http://digital.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/</a></p>

<h2 id="question5">Have you got printed brochures with the information on your site?</h2>

<p>We don’t have printed editions of the information on GOV.UK. However, at the bottom of each page there is a ‘Print this’ button that will produce a printer-friendly version of the page you are on.</p>

<p>Some government departments have printed editions of their content. Visit [a page] to find the contact details of the department you need. If you’re not sure who that is then contact us and we’ll help you to find out.</p>

<h2 id="question6">Is the information on this site up to date?</h2>

<p>All government departments work very closely with GOV.UK to make sure all information is accurate and up to date However, if you have concerns about anything you’ve read on GOV.UK then please contact us.</p>

<h2 id="question7">Has the website been tested?</h2>

<p>GOV.UK is being extensively and continuously tested with users, including users for whom English is not their
first language and users with disabilities. This helps us improve GOV.UK, as we measure how users respond to
the website, the various content formats we’ve implemented and the overall design and tone of our services and information.
We do this quantitatively - taking the timings and performance of the site throughout specific tasks - as well as qualitatively - getting overall perceptions of trust, reliability and satisfaction from users.</p>

<p>We are carrying out several distinct types of testing to measure how the site performs, including guerrilla testing, expert review, lab testing and summative testing. You can read more about our testing methodologies in a blog post here.</p>

<h2 id="question8">Are you monitoring what I look at?</h2>

<p>While we do monitor how people are using GOV.UK, we do not collect or store your personal information (e.g. your name or address) so this information cannot be used to identify who you are.</p>

<p>We use Google Analytics to store information about what pages users visit, how long they use the site, how they got here and what links are clicked on. We do not allow Google to use or share our analytics data. Google Analytics sets cookies to enable it to track this information. You can find out more at <a href="https://www.gov.uk/help/cookies">https://www.gov.uk/help/cookies</a>.</p>

<p>By analysing this information, we can understand where people are getting stuck, what is most used and least used etc. We can then make sure GOV.UK is meeting users’ needs and see how we could make it better.</p>

<h2 id="question9">Can I republish the information on this website?</h2>

<p>You can in some cases; GOV.UK is published under the Open Government Licence. Please read the licence before you republish any information to make sure that you meet all of the conditions of use.</p>

<p>I’m looking at at the Beta and it seems like there’s information missing The trial version of GOV.UK you can see today is a “beta” - many more pages, services and tools will be added to the site ahead of its official release on 17 October. That said, if you still don’t find what you’re looking for when the site launches, we’d welcome your more detailed feedback.</p>

<p>Just send your comments, along with links to pages you think need improvement, to this address and we will pass on to the appropriate teams.</p>

<h2 id="question10">What is GOV.UK’s linking policy?</h2>

<p>GOV.UK links out to external organisations when that link is essential for helping a user complete a task which they begin on the site. For example, we link people looking for information on university applications out to the UCAS website.</p>

<p>We will consider link requests from people who believe their sites fall into this ‘essential’ category, and our support desk will pass your request onto our content team.</p>
