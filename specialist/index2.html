        <p>Housing Benefit is worked out differently depending on your circumstances.</p>

        <h2>If you live in council accommodation or other social housing</h2>

        <p>The most Housing Benefit you can get is the same as your ‘eligible’ rent, which includes:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>rent for your accommodation </li>
          <li>charges for some services, eg lift maintenance, communal laundry facilities or play areas </li>
        </ul>

        <p>Even if it’s included in your rent, you won’t get any Housing Benefit for:</p>
        
        <ul>
          <li>charges for heating, water, lighting or cooking </li>
          <li>payments for food or fuel in board and lodgings or hostels </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Your circumstances</h3>

        <p>Your local council will also look at your personal and financial circumstances when they work out your Housing Benefit. They’ll look at:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>money you and your spouse or partner have coming in, including earnings, some benefits and tax credits, and occupational pensions </li>
          <li>your savings (and your spouse or partner’s savings) </li>
          <li>your circumstances - eg your age, your family and their ages, whether you or any of your family are disabled, and whether anyone who lives with you could help with the rent</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Your home and rent</h3>

        <p>Your council will also take into account your home and the rent you pay. They’ll look at whether:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>the amount of rent is reasonable for your particular home and the area where you live</li>
          <li>your home is a reasonable size for you and your family </li>
        </ul>

        <div class="application-notice info-notice">
          <p>Your ‘eligible rent’ might be limited to an amount that’s reasonable for a suitable property where you live.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>If you rent from a private landlord</h2>

        <p>The amount of Housing Benefit you get will be calculated using the Local Housing Allowance rates.</p>

        <p>It will depend on where you live and who lives with you.</p>

        <p>Local Housing Allowance rates are set for different types of accommodation in each area. The rates range from a single room in a shared house, up to properties with 4 bedrooms.</p>

        <h3>Local Housing Allowance limits</h3>

        <p>There are limits to the amount of Local Housing Allowance that can be paid:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>£250 a week for a 1 bedroom property (including shared accommodation)</li>
          <li>£290 a week for a 2 bedroom property</li>
          <li>£340 a week for a 3 bedroom property</li>
          <li>£400 a week for a 4 bedroom property</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="application-notice info-notice">
          <p>You can find the <a href="http://www.direct.gov.uk/en/Diol1/DoItOnline/DG_196239" title="Local Housing Allowance rates" rel="external">Local Housing Allowance rates</a> for where you live online.</p>
        </div>

        <p>If you’ve been getting Housing Benefit since before 7 April 2008, the Local Housing Allowance rules will only apply to you if you:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>change address </li>
          <li>have a break in your claim for Housing Benefit</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>How Housing Benefit is paid</h2>

        <p>If you’re a council tenant, your local council will pay any Housing Benefit straight into your rent account.</p>

        <p>If you’re renting privately, your Housing Benefit will be paid:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>directly into your bank or building society account</li>
          <li>to you by cheque, in some circumstances</li>
        </ul>

    <article role="article" class="overview-etc group" id="eligibility">
      <div class="inner">
      
        <header><h1>Eligibility</h1></header>

        <p>You may get Housing Benefit if:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>you pay rent</li>
          <li>your income, savings and investments are below a certain level - usually £16,000, unless you’re getting the ‘guarantee credit’ of <a href="/pension-credit" title="Pension Credit">Pension Credit</a>
          </li>
        </ul>

        <div class="application-notice info-notice">
          <p>It doesn’t matter whether you’re working or not.</p>
        </div>

        <p>If your household income, pension and any savings are more than £6,000, this may affect how much money you get.</p>

        <p>You can get <a href="/apply-housing-benefit-from-council" title="Housing Benefit information">more information on eligibility</a> from your local council. </p>

        <h2>Who isn’t eligible</h2>

        <p>You can’t usually get Housing Benefit if:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>you have savings of over £16,000, unless you’re getting the ‘guarantee credit’ of <a href="/pension-credit" title="Pension Credit">Pension Credit</a>
          </li>
          <li>you live in the home of a close relative </li>
          <li>you’re a full-time student (unless you’re disabled or have children) </li>
          <li>you’re an asylum seeker or are sponsored to be in the UK</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Other Housing Benefit rules</h2>

        <p>If you live with a partner, only one of you can get Housing Benefit.</p>

        <p>If you’re single and aged under 35, you can only get Housing Benefit for:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>bed-sit accommodation</li>
          <li>a single room in shared accommodation</li>
        </ul>
